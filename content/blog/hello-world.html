In Trestle, making posts is easy! Metadata is simply a JSON structure in a comment at the top of your HTML file.

Paragraphing is done automatically. You can even add code:
<code lang="perl">
use File::Slurp;
my $dictionary = read_file("words.txt");
chomp(my $input = <STDIN>);
my $regexText = "^[$input]+\$";
my @matches = $dictionary =~ /$regexText/igm;
print join("\n", @matches) . "\n";
</code>
